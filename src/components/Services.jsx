            <p className='text-white text-xl'>Unlike on social media, you have the full attention of your customers when they're on your website. Why waste bandwidth on stock photos and flashy animations? Nothing Fancy Websites are everything simple, and nothing fancy. Search Engine Optimization ("SEO") for Google, Bing and other search engines is built-in. If what you're selling is simply worth buying, then a Nothing Fancy Website is for you.</p>
